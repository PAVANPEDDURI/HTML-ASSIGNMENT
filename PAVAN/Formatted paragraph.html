        <abbr title="underline the CHANDRAYAN-3"> CHANDRAYAN-3</abbr> On 22 July 2019,ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 on 
        board a Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) launch vehicle consisting of an
        orbiter, a lander and a rover...

        </I><b>The Vikram lander was responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also box-shaped, 
            with four landing legs and
        four landing thrusters capable of producing 800 newtons of thrust each. It carried 
        the rover and has various scientific
        instruments to perform on-site analysis</b>The Pragyan rover is a six-wheeled vehicle with
         a mass of 26 kilograms (57 pounds). It is 917 by 750 by 397 millimetres
        (36.1 in × 29.5 in × 15.6 in) in size. The rover is expected to take multiple measurements to support research into
        the composition of the lunar surface, the presence of water ice in the lunar soil, the history of lunar impacts, and the
        evolution of the Moon's atmosphere.<BR><BR>
        <u>Landing</u>On 23 August 2023, as the lander approached the low point of its orbit, its four engines fired as 
        a braking manoeuvre at
        30 kilometres (19 mi) above the Moon's surface. After 11.5 minutes, the lander was 7.2 km (4.5 miles)
         above the surface;
        it maintained this altitude for about 10 seconds, then stabilized itself using eight smaller thrusters and rotated from
        a horizontal to a vertical position while continuing its descent.
        It then used two of its four engines to slow its descent to roughly 150 metres (490 ft); it hovered there for about 30
        seconds and located an optimal landing spot before continuing downward and touching down at 12:33 UTC.
